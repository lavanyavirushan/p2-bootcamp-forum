## Description
This application is a platform for past and present bootcamp students to connect, ask questions, mentor, and network with others going through the same experience. Unlike some other forums, even ones specifically for software development, this application is exclusively* for students in coding bootcamp programs, allowing users to have a much more personalized experience.

A key benefit to having this large, yet personalized application, is that if students are stuck on a weekly challenge or project, they can search by category to find a post with relevant information to their problem; if they don't see a solution already listed, they can create a post, specify the category and have a member from the community help them out. Having this information available to other users (rather than just in a direct message) will help future students who also face the same question. We envision these categories will not only include various coding languages, libraries, and projects, but also interview tips, job postings, & updates from within the coding community.

This application uses Node.js and a MySQL database, which is hosted & deployed on Heroku.

*Employers can also create profiles to find excellent job candidates, list job/internship postings, etc.
